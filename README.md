# Beyond the Gate: Driving Guest Satisfaction and Profitability Together
By Kevin Serrano Lopez

# Business Problem
The Supernova theme park is struggling with uneven guest satisfaction and inconsistent revenue, driven by long attraction wait times, unpredictable ride availability, and overcrowding.

Leadership needs a coordinated strategy that balances operational efficiency with targeted marketing to improve both guest experience and overall profitability.
